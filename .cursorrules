# Cursor AI Rules for this Project
# These rules guide Cursor's AI assistance to follow project conventions

## Code Style and Patterns
- Follow existing code style and patterns found in the project
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Write self-documenting code that minimizes need for comments

## Security Requirements
- ALWAYS validate and sanitize user inputs
- NEVER hardcode secrets, API keys, or credentials
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information
- Follow OWASP security best practices
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Sanitize outputs to prevent XSS attacks

## Error Handling
- Include try-catch blocks for all async operations
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors appropriately (but never log sensitive data)
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes

## Testing (when applicable)
- Write tests for new features
- Ensure tests are isolated and repeatable
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for meaningful test coverage, not just high percentage

## Documentation
- Add JSDoc/docstring comments for public APIs
- Update README when adding new features
- Document complex algorithms or business logic
- Keep inline comments minimal - prefer clear code

## Git Practices
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Don't commit commented-out code - delete it
- Don't commit debug logs or console.log statements

## Performance Considerations
- Avoid premature optimization
- Be mindful of database query performance (N+1 problems)
- Use pagination for large data sets
- Consider caching for expensive operations

## Project-Specific Rules
# Add your own project-specific rules here:
# - Use TypeScript strict mode
# - Follow REST API naming conventions
# - Use async/await instead of .then() chains
# - etc.
